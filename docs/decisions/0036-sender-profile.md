# ADR-0036 · Who's writing: the sender profile beside the mail (Phase 26)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-15
- **Builds on:** [ADR-0019](0019-connected-calendar.md) (mail and meetings on each contact), [ADR-0027](0027-faces-and-sources.md) (contact photos), [ADR-0035](0035-links-that-keep-up.md) (notes linked to people)

The [competitive analysis](../research/competitive-analysis.md) §3 credits **Superhuman's sender profile in the mail pane**: who someone is, and what you've done together, without leaving the message. Vale already had the pieces on each contact's card: photo, title, quick actions, recent mail, meetings, and notes. But reading their mail meant going to Contacts to see any of it. And people who aren't contacts had nothing at all.

## Decisions

### Beside the conversation when there's room, a tap away when there isn't

- **Wide reader:** a column on the right of the open conversation shows the person on the other side. That's whoever sent the newest message you didn't send.
- **The width that counts is the reader's own,** measured with a container query, not the window's. On a laptop with the list showing, the column folds away before it squeezes the message.
- **Narrow reader or phone:** an **About [name]** button in the conversation's toolbar opens the same profile in an adaptive sheet (below).

### The adaptive sheet: one component, the right metaphor for each size

A side panel suits a laptop. On a phone it wastes the screen and puts its close button out of reach. `AdaptiveSheetContent` (in `components/ui/sheet.tsx`) is one component with two forms:

| | Compact (below `sm`, phones) | Regular (`sm` and up) |
|---|---|---|
| Where | Slides up from the bottom, full width | Slides in from the right |
| Height | Three quarters of the screen, whatever the content, so it has room to breathe and the page behind stays in view | Full height |
| Shape | Rounded top corners, and a grab handle | Square, with a left border |
| Close | A small floating round button (40 px) in the bottom-right corner, within thumb reach (Apple's newer controls); dragging the handle down past 120 px, or 30% of the sheet's height; tapping outside | A button in the top corner; tapping outside; Esc |

- **Why a media query, not a container query:** a sheet is an overlay, so the viewport is its container. The profile *column* still uses a container query, because it lives inside the reader.
- **The content scrolls inside the sheet.** It leaves room at the bottom for the floating button and the home indicator.
- **Component tokens** (`--c-sheet-compact-height`, `--c-sheet-compact-radius`, `--c-sheet-handle`, `--c-sheet-close-size`, `--c-sheet-regular-width`) hold the sizes, so other sheets can share them.
- **The Calendars sheet** on phones (the calendar list) uses the same component, so the two sheets behave alike.

### What it shows

- **Their card, if they're a contact:** photo, name, title and company, and address. Otherwise it shows the name from their newest message, marked **Not in your contacts**.
- **One row of actions:**
  - **Email**;
  - **Call** and **Message** when the card has a phone number;
  - **Card**, to open the contact, or **Add**, which starts a new card with their name and address.
- **How long you've heard from them:** "3 messages from them since Oct 2026", counted from mail on this device.
- **What you've done together:**
  - upcoming meetings, with **Join**;
  - recent mail, which leaves out the open conversation, and where tapping a row opens it right here in Mail;
  - recent meetings;
  - their notes, with **New note**.

### Same person, same history

`sender_profile(email)` is one core call:

- **The card:** the card whose addresses include this one, ignoring case. When two cards share an address, the one whose name matches how they sign their mail wins; otherwise, the first by name.
- **The history:** comes from **all** the card's addresses, not just the one on this message. Mail from someone's work and personal accounts shows together.
- **Counts and the "since" date:** come from the messages table only. Nothing is fetched or guessed from the web, so there's no tracking and no social lookups.

## Verification

- **Core (`cargo test -p pim-core`, 202 tests):**
  - the card found by address, ignoring case, and by name when two cards share an address;
  - message count, first date, and the newest name;
  - a stranger, an unknown address, and refusing a non-address.
- **App (`cargo test -p pim-app`):** the command through the dispatcher, including the refusal.
- **Browser, demo (`phase26`, 19 checks):**
  - a contact's card with Email, Call, Message, and Card; how long you've heard from them; other mail but not the open conversation; a row opens in Mail; Card opens the contact;
  - a stranger is marked, and **Add** starts a card with their address;
  - a narrower window folds the column into a sheet, a panel on the right;
  - on a phone, it's a bottom sheet: full width, on the bottom edge, three quarters of the screen tall, with a 40 px close button in the bottom-right corner. That button closes it, and so does dragging the handle down.

  All earlier demo suites still pass.
- **Gateway (`gateway-p26`):**
  - either of a contact's addresses finds their card, with an empty history before any mail;
  - a stranger has no card;
  - a non-address is refused.

## Consequences

- **No outside enrichment:** no company logos, social profiles, or local time from a web service. Those would leak who writes to you. A contact's own fields are the only source.
- **Local time isn't shown.** Mail headers carry a sender's UTC offset, but the store keeps only the timestamp. Showing it would need a schema change, which can come later.
- **Group threads show the newest other sender,** not everyone. A people list for group threads can come later.
