//! The app itself, on top of `pim-core`: every command the UI calls, the
//! background workers (undo-send outbox, snooze wake-ups, sync, push), and
//! one [`dispatch`] that routes a command by name. The Tauri shell (desktop
//! and phones) and the web gateway are thin hosts around it (ADR-0016).
//!
//! Locking rule: the store mutex is never held across a network await.
//! Workers read what they need, release the lock, talk to the server, then
//! lock again to write the result.
